<p class="ph1">CENSUS STATISTICS OF THE NEGRO.</p>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no leading country in which the relations of widely
different races are so important as in the United States.
As a natural result of this, there is no country in which statistical
investigation of race questions is so highly developed, or in
which the records cover so long a time. In Europe it is not
customary to recognize or emphasize the race classification of
the population in statistical returns. In India the race classification
while recognized is subsidiary to that of religion
and of language. In American countries to the south of the
United States where race relations are as complex and as diverse
as they are with us, the statistical method is imperfectly developed
or of recent introduction. The main sources of statistical information,
therefore, regarding race relations are the figures for
the United States and those for several of the West Indian
Islands.</p>

<p>Since the Civil War the statistical study of certain aspects of
race questions in the United States has been entered upon by
different governmental agencies. The Department of Agriculture
has made investigations of the diet and food supply of
negroes and of whites with especial reference to the bodily heat
and the energy it can produce. The Department of Labor has
made a number of suggestive reports upon the condition of negro
communities in certain typical localities. Various municipal
health reports throw light upon the vital statistics of the two
races. The Bureau of Education has gathered much information
regarding the educational development of negroes and
whites. But no one of these and perhaps not all of them combined
have furnished or are furnishing at the present time as
much information regarding the statistics of race in the United
States as the Census Bureau.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is of the highest importance
that the information thus gathered should be carefully and intelligently
interpreted and its lessons correctly read. The object
of this paper is to state certain conclusions to which I have
been brought by my statistical studies of the subject and especially
of the recent census figures.</p>

<p>The population of the United States is divided by the census
returns into four classes, the native white of native parents, the
native white of foreign born parents, that is, the children of
immigrants, the immigrant or foreign born white class, and the
other races than the white, sometimes called collectively the
colored, perhaps more accurately described as the &#8220;non-Caucasians.&#8221;
The most accurate description of them is to enumerate
the great races to which they belong, namely, the negro, Indian
and Mongolian. Of this fourth group, the non-Caucasians, more
than nineteen-twentieths are negroes and therefore when statements
are made, as I shall be compelled sometimes to make
them, not for the negroes but for the non-Caucasians, it will
be understood that nineteen-twentieths of these are negroes and
what is true, therefore, of the non-Caucasians is probably true
of the negroes. These four classes correspond roughly to four
grades of economic well-being,&mdash;the native white of native
parents at the top, the negroes, Indians, and Mongolians at the
bottom. Now it is a general fact that the lower the scale of
economic well-being the less accurate on the average will be the
answers to questions put them. A measure of this can be derived
from the answers to the age question. It can be easily proved
that the errors in reporting ages among the immigrant white are
about twice as numerous as among the native white and among
the non-Caucasians about twice as numerous as among the
immigrant white. Where age is stated erroneously it is usually
stated at a round number as a multiple of 5. The excess in
the reported number at these multiples of 5 over the estimated
true number is thus a measure of the accuracy of the figures.
This excess in 1900 among persons between twenty-eight and
sixty-two years of age inclusive for the native whites was 12.4 per
cent. of the total estimated number at multiples of 5, for the
foreign born white 29.8, and for the negro 81.2. What is true
of the inaccuracies in the field of age statistics is probably true
of other sorts of inaccuracies. A larger proportion of the negro
population than of the white is homeless and therefore likely
to be omitted by enumerators instructed to visit every home in
the country. In Maryland a careful recount of nearly 63,000
people was had a few months after the census day in the effort
to detect suspected fraud. The recount showed that in the
original count the omissions among negroes had been 3.7 per
cent. and among whites 1.3 per cent. These omissions were
probably greater than in the general population, but it is not
unlikely that the per cent. of omissions among negroes is twice
as great as the per cent. among whites.</p>

<p>There is no race question upon which we have so great a
lack of scientific information at the present time as that of the
degree of direct intermixture of the two races. Public opinion
at the South seems to be almost unanimous in its belief that,
since the Civil War and emancipation, intermixture of the two
races has decreased and that the mulatto population at the present
time is largely the offspring of mulattoes alone or of mulattoes
and negroes, and that there has been relatively little new infusion
of white blood. But no statistical basis for this opinion exists,
and general observation on a question so difficult and delicate
must be regarded as a very slippery foundation for the belief.
Questions on this point were introduced into the censuses of
1850, 1860, 1870, 1880 and 1890, and the results were tabulated
and published for each of these censuses except 1880. Prior to
1890 the question was asked in substantially the same terms, that
is, simply the number of mulattoes. In 1890 unfortunately it
was sought to amplify the question and Congress required the
Census Office to report the number of mulattoes, quadroons and
octoroons. Such precision in this field is unobtainable and, in
natural reaction against the misleading results obtained in 1890,
the Office in 1900 omitted the question entirely. I cannot feel
that this was wise. The results obtained in 1850, 1860 and
1870 for the whole United States showed substantial agreement,
the per cent. of mulattoes among the total negroes having been
reported as in 1850, 11.2; in 1860, 13.2; in 1870, 12.0. These
figures cannot be accepted as showing an increase in the proportion
of mulattoes down to the Civil War and a slight decrease
after that time, much less can the slightly larger proportion of
mulattoes reported in 1890 (15.2 per cent.) with a different
form of question be regarded as any evidence of an increase of
race mixture since emancipation, but the general conclusion that
between one-eighth and one-ninth of the negro population at
about the time of the Civil War was mulatto may be regarded
as probable.</p>

<p>I believe that if the question should be repeated in 1910 in
substantially the same terms as those employed in 1850, 1860,
1870 and 1880, the results would be likely to indicate far more
accurately than general observation can do whether the proportion
of mulattoes among the negroes has increased or
decreased since emancipation. To establish this, one need not
believe that the reported percentages at former censuses were
correct. All that would be necessary for such a result would
be that the question put in substantially the same terms at intervals
during half a century would secure answers which if not
entirely accurate would at least err in the same direction and by
about the same amount.</p>

<p>At the present time there are about nine and one-fifth million
negroes under the United States flag, including those in Porto
Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii, as well as the negroes of continental
United States. This does not include the negritoes, much less
the Malays, of the Philippine Islands. In continental United
States, excluding Alaska and our insular accessions, there are
about eight and five-sixths million negroes. Nearly nine-tenths
of them (89.7 per cent.) live in the southern states, that is, the
states south of Mason and Dixon&#8217;s line, the Ohio River and the
parallel of the southern boundary of Missouri. The per cent.
living in the southern states, however, is very slowly decreasing.
In 1860, 92.2 per cent. were living there; in 1880, 90.5 per
cent.; in 1900, 89.7 per cent., or in other words, in 1860, 78
negroes among each 1,000 in the country were living outside of
the South, in 1900, 103 in each 1,000. Apparently there was
a considerable change in the distribution of the negroes as a
result of the upheaval in the Civil War. Then followed a period
of relative quiescence, but in the last decade of the century there
was an increase in the northward current of negro migration,
especially to northern cities. That the negro population in our
large cities is increasing with greater rapidity than the white
population appears clearly when the totals of the two races are
obtained for the thirty-eight cities which had at least 100,000
inhabitants in 1900. The increase of negroes in these cities,
1890 to 1900, was 38.0 per cent., and that of whites 32.7 per
cent., and in the five southern cities of this class, Baltimore,
Washington, Louisville, Memphis and New Orleans, the increase
of whites was 20.8, and of negroes 25.8 per cent. Washington
was the only southern city of this class in which the negro population
did not increase, 1890 to 1900, with greater rapidity than
the white. This rapid increase of the negro population in the
larger cities of the country is the more significant, because
thirty-three of these thirty-eight cities lie in the north and west
and therefore increase of their negro population usually results
from long distance migration, and because also the negro population
of smaller cities and of country districts has been increasing
as a rule less rapidly than the white population.</p>

<p>There is no traceable tendency to a separation between negroes
and whites in the South whereby the negro population is becoming
more predominant in the rural districts and the white population
in the cities. Perhaps the best evidence on this point is
that derived from the 242 cities in the South Atlantic and
South Central States, which had at least 2,500 inhabitants both
in 1890 and in 1900, and for which, therefore, the race composition
of the population was separately returned. The negro
population of these 242 places increased between 1890 and 1900
by 21.7 per cent., the white population by 26.5 per cent. The
negro population of the rest of the southern States outside these
242 places increased 16.4 per cent., while the white population
outside these 242 places increased 25.0 per cent. The figures
show the remarkable fact, which so far as I know is unparalleled,
that the growth of white population in the South has been almost
as rapid in the country districts as in the cities. Whether this
means that the white population is betaking itself more to agriculture,
it would be difficult to assert from the figures. The
negro population is increasing in southern cities about one-third
faster than in country districts. Or, the facts may be stated perhaps
more intelligibly in this way. In the 242 southern cities for
which the race figures are distinguished both for 1890 and for
1900, there were in 1890, 464 negroes to 1,000 whites; in 1900
there were 447, a decrease of 17. Meantime, in the country districts
there were in 1890, 522 negroes to 1,000 whites, and in 1900
there were 486, a decrease of 36. These figures show that the
decrease in the proportion of negroes relative to whites in the
southern States in the last decade has been twice as rapid in
the country districts as in the cities.</p>

<p>In studying the increase of the negro population it must be
borne in mind that the figures of 1870 are admitted to be seriously
inaccurate. There are some reasons also for doubting the
accuracy of the census of the negroes in 1890. In order to
avoid using these erroneous or questionable figures and also in
order to base the computation on long periods of time, the increase
has been computed by each of the five twenty-year periods
of the nineteenth century. As the negro problem is preëminently
one of interest to the South it seems fairer to compare the growth
of the two races in that region. Such a comparison shows
that the negro population of the South increased most rapidly
during the first twenty years of the nineteenth century and that
its rate of increase steadily declined to the end of the century.
The rate of increase of southern whites was highest not from 1800
to 1820, but 1840 to 1860. Perhaps the results may be stated
in a way to make them most easily intelligible by treating the
rate of increase of whites in the southern States in the given
twenty-year period as 100 and comparing with it the rate of
increase of southern negroes during the same period of time.
Following this method, the increase of the southern negroes,
1800 to 1820, was to that of southern whites as 125 to 100, that
from 1820 to 1840 was 110, that from 1840 to 1860 was 87, that
from 1860 to 1880 was 90, and that from 1880 to 1900 was 57.
These figures show that since 1840 the increase of southern
negroes has been less rapid than that of southern whites, that the
increase from 1860 to 1880 was relatively more rapid than in the
preceding or the following twenty-year period, suggesting that
the period of war and of reconstruction affected the increase of
the white race more than that of the negroes. At the beginning
of the nineteenth century the southern negroes were increasing
much faster than the southern whites. At the end of it they
were increasing only about three-fifths as fast.</p>

<p>But to complete the presentation of the results reached by
the Census Bureau on this point, it should be added that if the
results for the last twenty-year period be analyzed by decades
a different conclusion is indicated. Comparison of the rates of
growth of southern negroes and southern whites for those two
decades shows that the rate of increase for southern negroes,
1880 to 1890, was to that of southern whites as 55 is to 100,
while in the decade from 1890 to 1900 it was as 68 to 100.
I confess myself skeptical of the accuracy of these figures. It
is difficult for me to accept results which show on their face
that the rate of increase of southern whites east of the Mississippi
River was less, 1890 to 1900, than it was 1880 to 1890,
the rate falling from 19.1 to 18.7, while that for southern negroes
in the same area was much greater in the second decade, the rate
rising from 10.6 to 15.7. At the same time I see nothing better at
present than to mark these figures as questionable and to suspend
judgment until the results for 1910 are published. It may be that
the increase among the negroes has been affected by the marked
prosperity of the South in recent years and has been affected
more conspicuously than the figures for the whites.</p>

<p>With reference to <i>sex</i> it may be noted that there is an excess
of females among the negro population of the United States,
while this is not true either of the Indians or of the native whites.
Strangely enough, this excess of females is found even at the
very earliest ages. It is a general rule that the number of male
children born exceeds the number of female. Among 100
children born, on the average about 51 are male and 49 female.
The scanty records of births in cities where the negroes constitute
a considerable element of the population, show that in this
respect the negroes conform to the rule. Yet negro children
even at the very earliest ages, as enumerated by the census,
show an excess of females over males. This is true of negro
children under one month, and of each of the four other subdivisions
of age under one year. Indeed it is true for every
year of age up to nine. It may be noted that this anomaly
appears for the first time in the figures for 1900. Whether it
is due to the fact that that census first made the distinction
between negro population and the total colored, including the
Indians and Mongolians, I am unable to say.</p>

<p>In the city population of the United States as a rule, females
outnumber the males. This generalization holds true of the
great majority of cities east of the Mississippi River. It is
more true of the negroes than it is of the whites. In the southern
cities and towns having at least 2,500 inhabitants in 1900,
there were 9 more negro females than males in each 100 of
negro population. Among children the two sexes were approximately
equal in numbers, so that if the figures allowed us to
exclude the children the preponderance of females would be
still greater. The cause is doubtless to be found in large measure
in the greater demand and greater opportunity for female labor
in cities.</p>

<p>At the present time rather more than half of the negroes
over ten years of age are able to write. The per cent. of
<i>illiteracy</i> has decreased rapidly in the last ten years. In 1890
it was 57.1, while in 1900 it was 45.5. This rapid decrease
in negro illiteracy has gone on parallel with the rapid decrease
of illiteracy among whites. At the present time the negroes as
a race show about seven times the proportion of illiterates that
the whites do and about four times the proportion of illiterates
found among southern whites, and these ratios between the two
races have not materially changed since 1890. Illiteracy is
much more prevalent in the country districts than it is in the
cities. About half of the negroes living outside cities having
at least 25,000 inhabitants are illiterate, while in these cities less
than one-third are illiterate. The rapid development of the educational
system among negroes in the South has left clear traces
upon the proportion of illiterates in the several age classes. The
highest proportion of illiterates is found among negroes at least
sixty-five years of age, the lowest among negroes ten to fourteen
years of age. The difference between these two age limits
is rather greater than the difference between city and country
negroes, the illiteracy of all negroes over sixty-five being
rather greater than that of negroes in country districts, and the
illiteracy of negroes between ten and fourteen years of age being
rather less than that of all negroes living in cities having at
least 25,000 inhabitants. If the per cent. of illiteracy among
negroes should continue to dwindle in the future as rapidly as
it did, 1890 to 1900, an improbable contingency, negro illiteracy
would disappear by 1940.</p>

<p>No noteworthy results appear from the statistics of <i>marital
condition</i> among the negroes. They correspond closely with
the statistics for southern whites, the main differences being
that the race has a very much larger proportion of widowed
and divorced persons and that in the last ten years there has
been a decline in the proportion of adult negroes who were married,
while among southern whites there has been an increase
in the proportion who were married. Both races show a decided
increase in early marriages, this being true for the country as
a whole and probably the result of the high prosperity which
prevailed immediately before 1900.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important suggestions derived from the
analysis of the figures for the Twelfth Census are found in the
statistics of <i>occupations</i>. The detailed results of these must be
regarded as open to some question since the classification of
occupations is perhaps as difficult a problem as any with which
the Census Bureau has to grapple, and it is possible that the
figures for 1890 and 1900 may not in all cases be strictly comparable.
Still certain salient results appear to be established.</p>

<p>Among all the negroes at least ten years of age about five-eighths,
62.2 per cent., are engaged in money getting or gainful
occupations. The corresponding proportion among southern
whites is less than one-half (46.9 per cent.). The difference
between the two races is almost entirely explained by the greater
prevalence of money-getting occupations among female negroes,
41.3 per cent. of the negro females and only 11.8 per cent. of
the southern white females reporting a gainful occupation. This
fact accounts for about three-fourths of the entire difference
between the negroes and the southern whites. An explanation of
the remaining fourth is found in the fact that negro boys go
to work earlier and negro men retire later than white men. In
general it may be said that the lower the earning capacity of a
productive class the greater the quantity of labor required for
its support; the greater the prevalence, therefore, of female
labor, of child labor and of the labor of old men. Part of this
greater prevalence of child labor and old man labor is due to
the fact that the negroes are predominantly engaged in agriculture
and that this industry affords greater opportunities than
most others for the work of children and old men. Yet this
fact only partly accounts for the difference.</p>

<p>The most important specific occupations for the negroes are
those of agricultural laborers, farmers, planters and overseers,
and laborers not specified. These three classes are probably
more numerous than the total number of persons engaged in
agriculture, for the number of laborers not specified who were
engaged in other occupations than agriculture is probably greater
than the number of persons engaged in agriculture and not
enrolled in any one of these three occupations. The total number
of southern negroes, with the few Indians and Mongolians
engaged in this line of industry, increased between 1890 and
1900 by 30.4 per cent., the southern whites in the same occupations
increasing in the same period by 43.5 per cent. As a
result the non-Caucasians constituted in 1890 44.4 per cent. of
the population in these classes, while in 1900 they constituted
42.0 per cent. These three classes together include two-thirds
of all the negro breadwinners. In a number of specific occupations
involving some degree of skill, the non-Caucasians in the
South constituted a somewhat smaller proportion of the total
number of laborers in the South in 1900 than they did in 1890.
This statement holds true for launderers and laundresses, carpenters,
barbers, tobacco and cigar factory operatives, and engineers
and firemen (not locomotive). In some other leading
occupations the negroes were more numerously represented in
1900 than in 1890. These include in the professional classes,
teachers and clergymen, and in the skilled labor classes, miners
and quarrymen and iron and steel workers.</p>

<p>While the future of the negro race in the United States
seems to be essentially an industrial and economic question,
turning upon their efficiency in comparison with classes of the
population who compete with them in their staple occupations,
the net results of these various and complex industrial changes
can perhaps best be measured by the <i>vital statistics</i> of the race.
The Census Bureau has no direct information regarding births
or marriages. Its information regarding deaths is confined to
the negro population living in the registration area and amounting
to between one-seventh and one-eighth (13.4 per cent.) of
the entire negro population of the country, over 93 per cent. of it
living in cities. The death-rate of negroes in the registration
area in 1900 was reported as 30.2 per thousand, that of the whites
in the same area being 17.3. But of the negroes in this area
the majority were female and the female is the healthier sex.
They were also predominantly adult and the adult years are
the healthier ages. To allow for these differences a computation
has been made to ascertain what the death-rate for the
negroes for the whole country would be, if the death-rate
observed in the registration area for each sex and each age had
been true of the negroes of that sex and age in the country as a
whole. On this basis the estimated negro death-rate of the
United States as a whole is 34.2 instead of 30.2, or just about
double that of the whites.</p>

<p>In 1890 the death-rate of the negroes in the registration area
as distinguished from the Indians and Mongolians was not computed.
That of the three races combined, nineteen-twentieths
being negroes, was in 1890 29.9, and in 1900,29.6 per thousand, a
decrease of three deaths per 10,000. In the same area the death-rate
of whites in 1890 was 19.1 and in 1900, 17.3, a decrease
of 18 per 10,000. It is uncertain how far these figures may
be accepted as indicative of the actual changes. They are submitted
not as entirely trustworthy, but as the best information
available.</p>

<p>Indirect evidence of the birth-rate among the negroes may be
obtained by computing the number of children under five years
of age to each 1,000 women fifteen to forty-four. These computations
show a very marked decline between 1880 and 1900 in
the proportion of negro children, but show that the proportion of
children at the present time is greater for negroes than for whites.</p>

<p>But when the country is considered in sections separating the
population of the South from that of the North, different results
appear. Negroes, as a whole, have a larger proportion of living
children than whites, but paradoxical as it may seem, it is also
true that southern negroes have at present a smaller proportion
of living children than southern whites, and northern negroes
have a smaller proportion of living children than northern
whites. The difference in the proportion of children stated in
the preceding paragraph, in other words, is fundamentally
a geographical or sectional difference and not a racial one.
Negroes have a high proportion of children not because they
are negroes, but because nine-tenths of them live in the South
and show the effect of influences which establish a high birth-rate
there. The South at the present time is increasing in
population faster than the North, with all its immigration,
largely because 1,000 white women at the North, fifteen to forty-four
years of age, could show at the census only 470 children
under five years of age, while at the South 1,000 negro women
of those ages could show 621 children, and 1,000 white women
633 children. In the southern States prior to the Civil War
the proportion of children under five years of age to 1,000 women
of child-bearing ages was about the same for the two races.
The immediate result of the Civil War, emancipation and reconstruction,
was to decrease slightly the number of white women
and increase the number of negro children, so that in 1880 for
1,000 women of the specified race and of child-bearing age, there
were in the South 82 more negro than white children. In 1890
the difference in favor of the negro race had sunk to 17, and in
1900 it had disappeared and been replaced by an excess of 12
white children.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The American negro, after the turmoil of Civil War and reconstruction,
found himself thrown on his own resources as he
had never been before. This occurred at the beginning of a
period of rapid, almost revolutionary, industrial change in the
South, a change which did not at first affect seriously the staple
crops upon which most of the negro&#8217;s labor as a slave had been
spent, but which apparently is beginning to affect even those.
In seeking other avenues of self-support than agriculture and
domestic service, he is seriously handicapped by unfamiliarity
with such work, a lack of native aptitude for it, so it is alleged,
absence of the capital often requisite, and a preference on the
part of most of the whites, even when other things are equal,
as they seldom are, to employ members of their own race. In
the industrial competition thus begun the negro seems during
the last decade to have slightly lost ground in most of those
higher occupations in which the services are rendered largely to
whites. He has gained in the two so-called learned professions
of teachers and clergymen. He has gained in the two skilled
occupations of miner or quarryman and iron or steel worker.
He has gained in the occupations, somewhat ill-defined so far
as the degree of skill required is indicated, of sawing or planing,
mill employee, and nurse or midwife. He has gained in the
class of servants and waiters. On the other side of the balance
sheet he has lost ground in the South as a whole in the following
skilled occupations: carpenter, barber, tobacco and cigar factory
operative, fisherman, engineer or fireman (not locomotive) and
probably blacksmith. He has lost ground also in the following
industries in which the degree of skill implied seems somewhat
uncertain: laundry work, hackman or teamster, steam railroad
employee, housekeeper or steward. The balance seems not favorable.
It suggests that in the competition with white labor to
which the negro is being subjected he has not quite held his own.</p>

<p>These figures of occupations seem to me to furnish the best
statistical clue yet obtained for an understanding of the industrial
and social changes affecting this question in the South. My
interpretation of their meaning might be objected to on the
ground that when the negroes are increasing more slowly than
the whites, as they are at present in the South, it should not be
expected that they would increase as fast as whites in the skilled
occupations. This objection seems to me to invert the true order
of causation, to put the cart before the horse. Should we not
rather say that southern negroes are increasing at the present
time only two-thirds as fast as southern whites, while from
1800 to 1840 they increased faster and from 1840 to 1880 nearly
as fast, because they are not succeeding in entering new occupations
or prospering as well in their old as the competing race
is doing?</p>

<p>If this view of the process is correct, then one may add in closing
that, as these occupation figures throw much light upon the
causes, so the figures of an almost stationary death-rate for
negroes compared with a rapidly decreasing death-rate for
whites, and an apparently declining birth-rate for negroes compared
with an actually increasing birth-rate for southern whites,
are the best statistical keys to its effects.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
